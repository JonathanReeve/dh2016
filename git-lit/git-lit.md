#About

The Git-Lit project parses, version controls, and posts Git repositories for the British Library's ALTO XML documents. This has a number of effects useful to digital humanities scholarship. First, it allows for open collaborative editing of the texts, in order to crowdsource the correction of OCR errors and encourage the creation of new, decentralized scholarly editions. Second, it provides archival records of all changes through the use of modern version control systems. Third, it facilitates computational text analysis by enabling the automated retrieval and collection of large numbers of disconnected texts. The scripts used by Git-Lit transform the XML metadata for British Library texts into human-readable prefatory documents, version controls these documents along with the original texts, and pushes the resulting git repositories to GitHub. The resulting text repositories are then available for collaborative editing, using the fork/revise/pull request model long used by software developers.  

Future phases of the project will involve programmatically indexing the texts according to date and genre, and collecting these texts into parent repositories using git submodules. Text analysts would then be able to download a corpus of 19th Century Bildungsromane, for instance, simply by running two short commands: one for git-cloning a parent repository, and another to recursively initialize its submodules. This would constitute a revolutionary improvement in the retrieval speed of these corpora, and would allow the texts to be non-linearally curated into special interest categories. 

A subsequent phase of the project will automatically generate human-readable ASCIIDOC and richly annotated TEI XML versions of each text. The ASCIIDOC versions will be automatically rendered into web pages by GitHub, increasing exposure for the texts and encouraging collaborative editing; the TEI XML versions will allow for an archival-quality edition of the text that contains semantic markup of the text's literary features.  

The scripts for the project are currently operational with the four sample texts provided by James Baker of the British Library, and the output of these scripts can be found at the GitHub organization "Git-Lit." The project is currently awaiting access to the larger corpus of ALTO XML files.
